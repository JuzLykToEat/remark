1.  Inspect the following short pieces of code:

    PHP
    $a = ‘1’;
    $b = 2;
    $result = $a+$b;

    Javascript
    var a = ‘1’;
    var b = 2;
    var result = a + b;

    What is the value of '$result' (PHP) and result (JS)?


    Answer: the result in PHP will be an integer 3 while the result in javascript will be a string '12'


2.  Describe (in pseudo-code) a short algorithm which prints all primenumbers from 1 until 10.000


    Answer:
    FOR n = 1 TO 10000 DO
      i = 2
      answer = prime
      WHILE i <= n / 2
          rem = n % i
          IF rem is not equal to 0
              i = i + 1
          ELSE
              answer = not prime
              END WHILE LOOP
      IF answer is prime
          PRINT n


3.  Describe (in pseudo-code) a recursive method that is able to print the n-th number in the fibonacci series.
    Fibonacci: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 etc

    Answer:
    READ N
    FOR i = 1 TO N DO
      IF i is 1
        F1 = 1
        PRINT F1
      ELSE IF i is 2
        F2 = 1
        PRINT F2
      ELSE
        F3 = F1 + F2
        PRINT F3
        F1 = F2
        F2 = F3
      END IF-ELSE
    END FOR
